# 🧠 Edmund's Anaase AI - Real Reasoning Engine

## 🚀 Live Demo
**Deploy this repository to Vercel for instant AI deployment!**

## ✨ Features
- **Real Vector Search**: Semantic similarity matching using embeddings
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Multi-hop relationship traversal through entity connections
- **Rule-based Inference**: Forward-chaining logical reasoning with pattern matching
- **Explainable AI**: Complete reasoning traces showing how answers were derived
- **Domain Expertise**: Pre-loaded with GHChain & GOLDVAULT ecosystem knowledge

## 🎯 Try These Sample Queries
- "What is GH GOLD and how does it work in the ecosystem?"
- "Explain the relationship between GHChain and GOLDVAULT exchange"
- "How does the Anaase reasoning engine perform multi-hop inference?"
- "What DeFi applications are supported by the GHChain platform?"

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes with Edge Runtime
- **AI Engine**: Custom reasoning system with vector embeddings
- **Knowledge**: Graph-based entity relationships and rule inference
- **Deployment**: Vercel Edge Functions for global performance

## 🧠 Reasoning Architecture
The Anaase engine combines three core components:
1. **Semantic Search** - Vector similarity for document retrieval
2. **Knowledge Graph** - Entity relationship mapping and traversal  
3. **Rule Engine** - Pattern matching and logical inference
4. **Trace Generation** - Explainable reasoning with full transparency

## 🚀 One-Click Deployment

## 🔧 Local Development
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

## 📝 Adding Knowledge
Use the `/api/ingest` endpoint to add new documents:
```json
POST /api/ingest
{
  "id": "new-doc-1",
  "title": "Document Title",
  "content": "Your knowledge content here...",
  "metadata": {"topic": "blockchain", "importance": "high"}
}
```

## 🌟 What Makes This Special
